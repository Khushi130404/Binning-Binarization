# Binning-Binarization

This repository demonstrates the concepts of binning and binarization using the Titanic dataset. It explores the impact of numerical encoding on the results and compares the outcomes with and without applying numeric encoding techniques. Visualizations are provided to analyze the transformations and their effects on the dataset.

## Features
- Binning:- Dividing continuous numeric features into discrete bins.
- Binarization:- Converting numeric values into binary values based on thresholds.
- Comparison:-
  - With numeric encoding: Analyze the transformations after encoding categorical variables into numeric form.
  - Without numeric encoding: Observe the effects directly on raw numerical features.
  - Visualization: Generate graphs to visualize the effects of binning and binarization on the dataset.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, with the following key features:
- Age: Continuous numeric feature.
- Fare: Continuous numeric feature.
- SibSp: Discrete numeric feature.
- Parch: Discrete numeric feature.
- Survived: Binary target variable.
